# Four In A Row Game

This is the game four-in-a-row made with JavaScript classes. This game was taught to me as part of a Treehouse tutorial in their Full-Stack JavaScript track.

## Introduction

Upon loading the page the user should press the start button which appears in the middle of the screen. After that a board and chip will generate and the users may use the arrow keys to direct the chip. Once the desired location to drop the chip has been identified, the user should use the down arrow key to play the chip.
